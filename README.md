# bamazon
Bamazon will give the user a list of 10+ items for them to look through and choose from. It tells the user the stock of the item, the department the item was made in, and the price of the item. The user will be showed all of the above information, as well as a id for each of the items. Bamazon will  ask the user for the id of the specific item they want. Once the user chooses an id of the item they want, the terminal will ask how many of the item the user wants. If there is enough of the item in stock then bamazon will console log "you have sucessfully purchased the item." and the database will change the stock number. If there is not enough of the item in stock,bamazon will console log "there is not enough in stock." and will take the user back to choosing an item.
